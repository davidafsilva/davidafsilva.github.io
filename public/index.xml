      <description>My name is David and i&amp;rsquo;m the author of this website / blog. Yeah, no shit sherlock.
I am a passionate Software Engineer and Security enthusiast. I do enjoy trying out and poke around with different technologies and frameworks as well as develop my own random ideas. Some of these can be found at GitHub. Unfortunately I&amp;rsquo;m not as active as I once used to be. Family happens and priorities change I guess ðŸ˜‰</description>
