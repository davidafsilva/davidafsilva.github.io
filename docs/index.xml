      <description>In this blog post, we&amp;rsquo;ll start by briefly explaining the purpose of annotation processors and how can we create and register one for fun (the profit will come later!). Grab a cup of coffee and let&amp;rsquo;s go! ☻
Annotation Processor First of all, I&amp;rsquo;ll assume you&amp;rsquo;re already familiar with annotations, if that&amp;rsquo;s not the case, feel free to read Oracle&amp;rsquo;s documentation[1] on it.
Annotation Processors are essentially a mechanism designed to process annotations - I bet you did not expect this one - at compile time.</description>

      <description>So, after pushing away the OCA Java SE 8 Programmer I[1] exam for a gazillion years (originally, the SE 7 version), last June (2016), I&amp;rsquo;ve been given the opportunity (indeed, a voucher) to take the exam, but guess what? I simply forgot. Well, not forgot, but I thought the voucher was due in June 2017, 1 year after the purchase, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t - yeah i know, I am an idiot&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>My name is David and i&amp;rsquo;m the author of this website / blog. Yeah, no shit sherlock.
I am a passionate Software Engineer and Security enthusiast. I do enjoy trying out and poke around with different technologies and frameworks as well as develop my own random ideas. Some of these can be found at GitHub. Unfortunately I&amp;rsquo;m not as active as I once used to be. Family happens and priorities change I guess ☻</description>
